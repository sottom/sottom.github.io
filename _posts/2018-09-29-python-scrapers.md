I spend a ton of time every week checking my class pages to see what homework is due, and I'm getting a little tired of it, so I decided to make a scraper to get the homework instead. I currently scrape the homework and just print it out in my terminal, but eventually I'm going to connect it to my Google Calendar and hopefully create a chrome extension out of it so that other BYU students can benefit from it too!

I used python and Selenium Chrome-Driver to automate my browser. Here's a little demo (click to see the youtube video).
