This was one of the more unique coding experiences I've ever had. I got paid to make a video game to help youth enjoy learning about geneology.

We used the HTML5 Phaser framework to create the video game, and did all of the Object Oriented Programming in Typescript. 

The only way to understand it is to try it out, so give the image a click and play for a little while (you will need to sign in with your google account, but trust me, it's worth it)!

(Making the code to squish the spider in Grandpa's Attic was one of my favorite tasks!)
