I'm currently in a Data Analytics and Machine Learning class (Fall 2018), and we've been doing some data visualizations with Tableau. I'm still learning, but here is a story I made regarding what causes a tweet about AWS on Twitter to get retweeted.

### Tableau AWS Tweets Analysis
This chart looks at posts with over 100 retweets by gender. males seem to have more highly retweeted posts. One possible explanation for this trend is that there could be more male posters in this market, which would explain why they have more highly retweeted posts.

This chart shows the retweet count and the sentiment analysis of the tweets. It seems that neutral and slightly positive posts have the highest retweet count. A possible explanation for this is that most people are by nature non-confrontational, so negative post retweets are avoided in general. This is my supposition and would require further exploration and more data to prove.

This chart shows which countries have the most retweet counts for their posts. It would seem that countries other than the US have the most retweets. A possible explanation for this is that retweeting is more prevalent in different cultures outside the US. Survey data on how comfortable people are retweeting others' posts would need to be gathered to validate this explanation.
