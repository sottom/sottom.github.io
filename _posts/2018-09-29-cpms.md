I got my first web dev job two and a half years ago at the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (CPMS) on BYU campus. I was straight out of my first web dev class and raring to go. My task was to build a hiring site for eight college departments so that students could apply to be research assistants to professors.

As the site was close to being finished and the deadline approaching, my boss (who wasn't a tech person) asked if we could put it up a couple weeks earlier than planned. As far as I knew, the site worked perfectly. I had tested it manually several times on my own machine and everything worked perfectly. Testing with real users was probably a waste of time anyway, right? 

Wrong. Dead wrong. Turns out my code had a few bugs and the databases in our office had a lot of bad data. The combination of the two caused a lot of issues for a lot of people and I spent the next week putting out fires. It was one of the most miserable experiences I've ever had. 

After a week, we had to pull the new system offline, take 2 months to fix it and really test it, and then redeploy it. The second time was a great success, and the site is still being used two and a half years later.

After over a month of receiving less than friendly emails from upset people about my failed first attempt at the site, I was surprised that I felt like I still wanted to pursue a development type career. I genuinely loved developing!

This first experience taught me more about development than any other experience since. As a result, I have been a better learner, a better programmer, a better critic of my work, and a much more confident person.

### Technologies
I used AngularJS for the frontend, CodeIgniter (PHP) for the backend, and a MySQL database.
