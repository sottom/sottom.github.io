In Winter Semester of 2018, I took a Project Management class from a nice older gentleman named Ernie Nielson. We learned a lot of things, but the thing I remember most is the Agile Methodology.

For those that don't know, Agile Methodology says that when building a product, you should consult with end-users often and iterate on your ideas often. You progress in short "sprints." This allows you to change your direction as you get end-user feedback. I remember the Agile Methodology because I found out that my internship as a Chrome Extension Developer the previous summer had used it to a certain degree (though I didn't know at the time), and because I *my teacher was one of the thirteen-ish people at the original meetings when Agile was created!* I was being taught by one of the greats!

It was an awesome class, and helped me understand what I could have done better when I was the Program Director at a Camp Morrison Boy Scout Camp like 3 years ago.
