In Winter Semester of 2018, I took a Project Management class from a great professor named Ernie Nielson. One of the main focuses of the class was Agile Methodology.

In contrast to the Waterfall Methodology which has no iteration, Agile Methodology says that while building a product, you should consult with end-users and iterate on your ideas often. You progress in short "sprints." This allows you to change your direction as you get end-user feedback. Agile Methodology stuck out to me because I realized that I had unknowingly used it in my internship as a Chrome Extension Developer the previous summer, and because my teacher was one of the people at the original meetings where Agile was created! I was being taught by one of the greats! 

It was an awesome class, and helped me understand what I could have done better when I was the Program Director at a Camp Morrison Boy Scout Camp 3 years ago. I was in charge of training, leading, and motivating 70+ employees between the ages of 15 and 75. We provided 40+ merit badge classes for over 2500 youth and adults. I was always very involved with the classes at Camp Morrison, but I rarely took the time to think deeply about the customer feedback we got at the end of each week. Had I known more about Agile Methodologies and iterating based on customer feedback, I would have spent more time speaking with the people who left reviews so that I could understand how to better the product we were providing.
