I built a basic food storage tracker application that used Polymer on the frontend, Express (Node) on the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The front and backends communicated solely via AJAX.

Simply put, Polymer is a component based frontend framework like Angular or React, but it used the HTML5 web component specification unlike Angular and React. The benefit of using the HTML5 specification is that Polymer components will last forever because HTML will last forever! As Javascript changes, React and Angular components may stop functioning correctly.
