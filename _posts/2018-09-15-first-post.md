### Who am I?
My name is Mitchell Sotto. I'm a masters student in the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University studying Information Systems Management. If this were a resume, that's about all I could fit on the page, which is why I'm starting this blog. I need a way to get my real thoughts out about the experiences that I've been having at work, school, and anywhere else so that people actually understand what I do, and like to do with my time.

Here's a resume I made recently for recruiting:

---
<object data="/assets/Resume_9_5_18.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
   <p><b>Example fallback content</b>: This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: <a href="/assets/Resume_9_5_18.pdf">Download PDF</a>.</p>
</object>

Doesn't look too shaby right? Well, most resumes in the Marriott School of Business look exactly the same, so it can be hard to stand out, even if you have great experience under your belt. This blog is, in essence, a way for me to show some of the more important things that recruiters are looking for -- personality, thought process, passion, etc.. Interesting or not, I think it will help people get to know me a little better.

So there's my intro. Stay tuned for more posts to come relating to some of the things on my resume...
