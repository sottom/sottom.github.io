I did an internship with a company called iServe this summer, and they invited me to continue working part time while I'm in school. iServe is a startup of four and half years that is exploding in its industry. iServe partners with firms like Skullcandy to do two things: 1) Help Skullcandy enforce that no online sellers are selling Skullcandy products below Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) because it hurts the brand image, and 2) help sell Skullcandy's products online. 

Here's a list of some of my accomplishments over the past 5 months.

### Accomplishments
- I'm currently working on a microservice to automate the fulfillment of 500+ orders per day on eBay using a Rails API.
- I provided data used to gain partners like Skullcandy by scraping Amazon and Walmart with Rails, Splash Servers, Proxy IPs, and Lua Scripts. 
- I increased frontend development speed by helping to create a React component library that is being used in all frontend dev projects going forward
- I improved brand managers abilities to quickly respond to product reviews by creating an internal tool in React.

I have used PostgreSQL databases with all of my projects at iServe.
